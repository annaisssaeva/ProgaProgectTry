Daisy by PENTAGON
A night like a lie, a memory like a beggar
I don't want to go back anymore
Love is burning
All burning
All the memories are burning

Oh, very, very, long
I hope you go far away (don't leave)
Oh very, very, long
I hope you miss my side (Whoa-oh-oh)

There is no mercy, no mercy, my heart is privacy
It doesn't matter what you do
I just want you to be unhappy (I hope)

A daisy in my dreams
I'm a daisy in love
I don't have you, but I'm going crazy

White petals daisy
In that, I'm crazy again
Like a fool
I loved you, but what is this

All lies are lies
All lies are lies
All lies are lies
Daisy in false love

I'm sorry, it's late at night eh-oh
I came because there were some things I couldn't say
I'm not bare-minded, my memories are faint
Why does my heart keep hesitating

Your cold eyes, the faded red light
No matter what you say
I hope you are really unhappy

A daisy in my dreams
I'm a daisy in love
I don't have you, but I'm going crazy

White petals daisy
In that, I'm crazy again
Like a fool
I loved you, but what is this
All lies are lies
All lies are lies
All lies are lies
Daisy in false love

Love that sheds tears in lies
It's a crying blue bird, flying away
A person crying over lies
I'm just living
You are a bright sun
You should be happy in the end

White petals daisy
Stop it now, don't hate me
Like a fool
I was happy to be able to love

Don't go don't go don't go
Don't go don't go don't go
My eternal daisy

Always with you, no matter what you say, yeah, yeah

Can't let it go in my head all day and night (All day)
If I just pray, I get an answer always (Always)

Sha La La by Pentagon

So many things happened that angered me
I'm just gonna wipe it away
I was gonna say some bad words
But I'm just looking at the moon instead
Instead of getting stressed, I'll dress up
Please don't kill my vibe

Everyone says it's hard
If it was easy, it'd just be a game
Can't be the best? Eh
That's okay, just be yourself

I'm not the loser that I was yesterday
Today, I'll shine, I'm better now

Let's enjoy this Saturday night
Come and get it, come and get it, come and get it
It's lit, lit, lit
Come and get it, come and get it, come and get it

Pierce the ceiling and fly, shine a light
With feeling, sha la la
Let's enjoy this Saturday night
Come and get it, come and get it, come and get it
It's lit, lit, lit

Yeah, I don't know what I was in my past life
But like the lazy grasshopper
I'll just live my life and go
Be kind (dude)
You won't get anywhere with that Nolbu attitude
Let's be happy mom, sister, let's live by the river
The best moment of our lives is right now
Let's pack our bags and go

I don't need to be too self-conscious
I have enough grace, right?
Can you feel it? Sha la la, no need of video

I'm not the loser that I was yesterday
Today, I'll shine, I'm better now

A small, twinkling star is dancing in my heart
Don't try to decide what's right or wrong
Just like me (everyone together)
Let's take this night, fire!

Fire on my feet
Let's run even harder, pour gasoline on it
When people say you're too slow
Just ignore that rubbish
Yes, I like this
Don't ever try to be too cautious
Don't worry about tomorrow
Know your enemy and know yourself
100 battles, 100 victories
It's so hot, hot, let's cheers

Pierce the ceiling and fly, shine a light
With feeling, sha la la

Eh, eh
Love, fall (Eh)
Hurt, and crazy (Eh)

Shh! Yeah, that's right
Playing with my heart with your pretty eyes
Gratatata already, catch me
Playing hard to get, baby, your gestures drive me crazy

Please don't fade away, don't leave me
Night that moon falls apart, broken heart
Days after leaving me behind
You'll move on and forget me just like that
Even though I'm in pain

What should I do? Oh my, I'm in pain
You are the only one who can heal me
Please come back to me

Hey Dr. BeBe
Could die for you
If I only have you, BeBe
Could go crazy for you
Stuck inside your wall, struggle to escape, get hurt
But can't get away from the echo

Love, fall, hurt and crazy, again and again
Love, fall, hurt and crazy, love is
Love, fall, hurt and crazy
Hey Dr. BeBe, save me BeBe

Infinite dreams like the universe I think I heard you calling
But it's not true
Why do I feel severely in pain?
I need you, so please heal me, doctor
We adore and fight, love and hatred, go crazy and so on

What should I do? Oh my, I'm in pain
You are the only one who can heal me
Please come back to me

Hey Dr. BeBe
Could die for you
If I only have you, BeBe
Could go crazy for you
Stuck inside your wall, struggle to escape, get hurt
But can't get away from the echo

Love, fall, hurt and crazy, again and again
Love, fall, hurt and crazy, love is
Love, fall, hurt and crazy
Hey Dr. BeBe, save me BeBe

(Please, with me)
Clouds like a picture, calling of a blue dream
(Stay with me)
Melody for you who is hiding in the dark
Yo, don't make an excuse
Yeah, because of the wind
My nostalgia for you is getting stronger and I go crazy
Oh, I awake when you call my name (awake)

Hey Dr. BeBe
Could die for you
If I only have you, BeBe
Could go crazy for you
Stuck inside your wall, struggle to escape, get hurt
But can't get away from the echo

Love, fall, hurt and crazy, again and again
Love, fall, hurt and crazy, love is
Love, fall, hurt and crazy
Hey Dr. BeBe, save me BeBe


Humph! by PENTAGON

Rock paper scissors, minnie miney mo
Hold up, time, that's against the rules, you almost had me
You were too late, redo
Why won't you admit it, your eyes are as round as a cat

I won't let you off the hook today, I did that too much in the past
I need to say what I need to say, right?
I'm the only one who gets mad every day, it's too much, right?
You can't come closer, you can't come closer

No matter how sadly I talk, you keep a poker face
You're an ice fairy, not even blinking
I'll need to get my anger to melt you down
Don't cross the line, I'm still a child, stop right there

You can't come closer, you can't come closer now
You can't come closer till you apologise
You can't come closer, you can't come closer now
You can't come closer till you apologise
I'm really mad
Till you apologise
You can't come closer, you can't come closer

You crossed the line right now
Please keep your promise
I'm 100% mad, but I have multiple personalities
When I see you I get happy again, SOS yo

Dracula's teeth, broken glass, be careful
My sharp mood is unknown, an eighth mystery
I like you so much but my back's turned on you
I just want you to come to me first

No matter how sadly I talk, you keep a poker face
You're an ice fairy, not even blinking
I'll need to get my anger to melt you down
Don't cross the line, I'm still a child, stop right there

You can't come closer, you can't come closer now
You can't come closer till you apologise
You can't come closer, you can't come closer now
You can't come closer till you apologise
Saying sorry is like picking a star
Should I just go to you and hold your hand?
No, I'm closing my eyes, never, no

You can't come closer, you can't come closer now
You can't come closer till you apologise
You can't come closer, you can't come closer now
You can't come closer till you apologise
I'm really mad
Till you apologise
You can't come closer, you can't come closer


Shine by PENTAGON

I sort of... Uhm
From a long time ago, I've li...li...liked you always
What makes the difference if I tell you that now?

You have an unchanging mind
You're like a deep-rooted tree
A flower beautifully made by God
Don't disappear, don't change

Even if I like you, nobody knows
Even if I look at another girl, nobody's like you
I don't have courage, I'm sorry
Laugh at me as much as you like

Yes, I am a loser, loser who loves you
Yes, I'm a fool, fool
I'm a leech and outsider to you
You're the only one I want in this world
Baby, I'm only yours, oh, oh, oh (Like you!)
I'm only yours, oh, oh no (Oh no)
(After all, I am)
Always a loser in front of love

Uhm, uhm, I sort of might still like you a lot
Why can't I tell you? I'm like a discouraged child
Uhm, uhm, Don't see someone else

Don't do that, you'll break my heart
You're such a flawless person
Don't I deserve you?
My empty heart is so vacant but my mind is full of thoughts
Oh mom, when did it happen?

Even if I like you, nobody knows
Even if I look at another girl, nobody's like you
I don't have courage, I'm sorry
Laugh at me as much as you like

Yes, I am a loser, loser who loves you
Yes, I'm a fool, fool

I'm only yours, oh, oh no (Oh no)
After all, I am
Always a loser in front of love

It's Yuto
You become my memory, the sky is shining
I hope my heart can reach you
Even if I don't have to say, know, know, know
Always my heart is for you, you, you
I want to walk with the beautiful you

Everybody knows, I have one thing to tell you
Listen to my heart, I get nervous in front of you
Yes, love you, love you, love you
Like you, like you, like you
I love you

Yes, I am a loser, loser who loves you
Yes, I'm a fool, fool
I'm a leech and outsider to you
You're the only one I want in this world

(Everybody says) Nu-nu-na-na, you and I
(My baby!) Close your eyes, what shall we do?
(Kiss, kiss!) Gugu-kkakka, butterfly
Finally, I will always shine in front of love
